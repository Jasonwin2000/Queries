Like all students that I would assume were to say this, but I deserve to earn an "A" in my portfolio. Why I should earn this "A" you 
asked me? It is because I only just didn't use my textbook in order to fulfill my 50 queries, I also created my own queries from scratch.
I took my father's advice of what he gave me and I turned his help into my new code. I didn't mention this in the beginning but my father
implemented inside my laptop all of his queries that were notes on SQL while doing his job. I could have just not do any of my work in this
class, and use his code to substitute all 50 of my queries. But I didn't want to do so because I wanted to have my own experience while 
exploring under the new language 'SQL'. I have also made queries that were not from the web or textbook. What i meant by that is someone 
could try to find what I used in order to code "show all of the amount of columns in each database under a server in a query." and he or 
she would have a hard time because it isn't coding under a beginner's coding capabilities.
